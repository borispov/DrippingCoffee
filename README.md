# Astroweb

This project is a pet/side-project. IT's a blog in the coffee niche, trying to compete with SEO.

Legitimately writing about coffee topics, I have an obsession with coffee. 

This file will serve as a template for future blogs in case of success.

## SUCCESS  - DEFINED

I currently have troubles with getting all my pages indexed properly. This could be due to redirection errors early on, making google reluctant to re-index pages that failed before.

I will let this site live for another 6 months and see how it goes.

## TODO

1. Write about Gaggia Classic Pro - Owning it, selling it, pros, cons, address updates
2. second
3. third
