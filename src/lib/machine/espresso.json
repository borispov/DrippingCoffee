The Rocket, as most HX machines, require a backflush to get to the desired temperature, unlike the Mara X.",

With its sleek stainless steel design and customizable settings, the Vivaldi II caters to both home baristas and small commercial setups. Its versatility, combined with its attention to temperature stability and ergonomic design, establishes the La Spaziale Vivaldi II as a standout choice for those seeking high-performance espresso craftsmanship.",

          "The Vibiemme Domobar Super is a rock-solid machine invented back in the 70s or 80s. It has known a lot of improvements since then and it's a beast by today standards.",
          "The latest model was released in 2019, a dual boiler electronic beast. However, it has a brother Heat Exchanger. Personally, I find the 2B more appealing, being a top-end home coffee espresso machine.",
          "The LED touch display is somethng to love or to hate, but I can't deny the appeal of it. It's convenient to use, to change profiles, to adjust steam pressure directly without having to fuss with temperature manually.",
          "Despite all the positives, this machine is more of a rarity (IMHO) in the US, it's sold more often in Australia and NZ. Community and parts availability is an important factor to consider when buying a machine."
