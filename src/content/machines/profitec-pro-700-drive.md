# Profitec Drive: The Evolution of the Pro 700

[The Old Profitec 700 review](/machines/profitec-pro-700/)

Profitec, known for its superior and reliable espresso machines, has introduced the Drive as a successor to the highly-rated Pro 700. Developed with input from Whole Latte Love, the Drive maintains the core philosophy of the Pro 700 while introducing several key upgrades and new features.

I'd say the craziest feature of this machine is the insanely quick
warm-up time of just 10-12 minutes. Okay, this is in paper, right? Who
cares, give it 15 minutes. It's 3 times faster than it used to be and
faster than most traditional E61 groups!

## Key Upgrades and New Features

1. **Quick Heating Mode**: The Drive can be ready to make coffee in 10-12 minutes, a significant improvement over its predecessor.

2. **Pre-infusion**: Unlike the Pro 700, the Drive offers both active and passive pre-infusion with programmable times.

3. **Quick Steam Valves**: The Drive replaces the Pro 700's regular knob valves with joystick-style valves for instant on/off control.

4. **Programmable On/Off Times**: Users can set two on/off times per day for each day of the week.

5. **OLED Display**: The Drive features a plain language display for easier access to functions and settings.

6. **Flow Control**: While available as an add-on for the Pro 700, flow control comes standard on the Drive.

7. **Removable Cup Rail**: The Drive includes a removable cup rail for increased clearance.

8. **Aesthetic Upgrades**: The Drive sports a cut-out Profitec logo on the back and a black cup rail for a stylish accent.

## Enhanced Programming and Control

The Drive's OLED display allows for easy access to a range of programmable features, including:

- Brew and steam temperature adjustments
- Pre-infusion settings
- Eco mode settings
- Cleaning and filter reminders
- Timer enable and clock set
- Tank mode selection (reservoir or plumbed)
- Temperature unit selection (Celsius or Fahrenheit)
- Coffee offset correction
- Fast heating enable/disable

## Performance Improvements

1. **Temperature Accuracy**: Tests show the Drive's brew temperatures are within 1°F of the PID setting.

2. **Milk Frothing**: At maximum steam boiler temperature, the Drive can froth 5 oz of milk to 140°F in 21 seconds.

3. **Flow Control**: The stock flow rate is 11 grams per second, with the ability to achieve up to 25-27 grams per second.

## Under the Hood

While maintaining many of the Pro 700's internal components, the Drive adds a battery to hold the time of day in memory for programmability. Profitec continues to follow the "KISS" (Keep It Simple, Stupid) design principle, ensuring reliability and ease of maintenance.

## Conclusion

The Profitec Drive builds upon the success of the Pro 700, introducing modern features and quality-of-life improvements while maintaining the core reliability and performance that made its predecessor popular. With its enhanced programmability, improved steam control, and standard flow control, the Drive represents a significant evolution in Profitec's lineup, catering to both novice users and coffee enthusiasts alike.
