### Profitec Pro 700 vs Lelit Bianca

First, let's make this very clear: both are great machines and you'll be
just right with either of them. YOU should probably get the machine that
is cheaper, that is available with warranty, that *feels* best for you. Most users will NOT need the flow
control knob and will only mess their coffee and waste shots, get
frustrated very fast and forget about the knob altogether for the
forseeable future. However, you're probably not most users, right? Thus,
let's go over some differences.

The main difference between the flow control on the Bianca and the Profitec Pro 700 is that the Bianca's paddle cannot completely shut off the flow, while the Profitec Pro 700's flow control attachment can.

Next, we have a difference in boiler size and initial warm-up time.
Lelit Bianca is superior in that regard. The Profitec 700 takes around
45 minutes to get to stable temperature without internvention, while
Bianca users report between 20-30 minutes due to how it was designed and
engineered.
