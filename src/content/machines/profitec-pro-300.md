The Profitec Pro 300 is a dual boiler espresso machine designed for home and office use, offering high-end features at a more accessible price point. This compact machine measures 255mm (W) x 415mm (D) x 385mm (H) and weighs 18 kg, making it suitable for smaller spaces.

## Key Features:

- Dual boiler system: 0.325L brass brew boiler and 0.75L stainless steel steam boiler
- PID temperature control for the brew boiler
- Integrated shot timer
- Fast heat-up time: approximately 5 minutes for the brew boiler
- Vibration pump (Ulka EX5)
- 3L water tank capacity
- No-burn steam wand with two-hole tip
- Boiler pressure gauge

## Pros:

- Excellent build quality with high-grade stainless steel construction
- Quick heat-up time for both boilers
- Good steam power and microfoam quality
- Compact size and relatively portable
- PID control for precise temperature management
- Quiet vibration pump

## Cons:

- Some users report quality control issues (e.g., boiler leaks)
- Steam wand may be short for larger pitchers
- Lacks some advanced features found in higher-end machines (e.g., pre-infusion, adjustable brew pressure)
- Plastic steam and water knobs (replaceable with wood options)

The Profitec Pro 300 stands out as one of the first affordable, high-quality dual boiler machines on the market, priced below Â£1500. It offers a good balance of features and performance for home baristas looking to step up their espresso game without breaking the bank. While it may lack some advanced features found in more expensive models, its compact size, fast heat-up time, and dual boiler capabilities make it an attractive option for those seeking quality espresso and milk-based drinks at home.

## Profitec 300 vs Lelit Elizabeth

The Profitec Pro 300 and [Lelit Elizabeth](/machines/lelit-elizabeth/) are both compact dual boiler espresso machines popular among home baristas. The Pro 300 is known for its solid German engineering, fast heat-up time, and endless steam power. It's built to last and offers easy access to spare parts. However, some users find it dated, as the design hasn't changed since its 2015 release. The Pro 300 uses a PID for the brew boiler and a pressure stat for the steam boiler, which some consider an odd combination.

In contrast, the [Lelit Elizabeth](/machines/lelit-elizabeth/) is praised for its more advanced features, including programmable pre-infusion and higher steam pressure (up to 2 bar). It also boasts a quieter vibration pump, which can be a significant factor for noise-sensitive users. The Elizabeth's interface allows for more control and customization compared to the simpler Pro 300. Both machines have similar boiler sizes and use ring group heads, but the Elizabeth is generally considered more feature-rich and modern in design.

Ultimately, the choice between these machines depends on user preferences. The Pro 300 is favored by those who want a no-frills, reliable machine with a focus on build quality. The Elizabeth appeals to users who desire more control over their espresso extraction and appreciate additional features like pre-infusion. Both machines are capable of producing excellent espresso, but the Elizabeth may have an edge for those working with lighter roasts due to its pre-infusion capabilities.

On a personal note, I'd rather take the Lelit Elizabeth anyday.
