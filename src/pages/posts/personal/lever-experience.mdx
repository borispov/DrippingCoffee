### The Lever Experience

As a proud owner of the Profitec 800, I want to share my subjective ownership experience. 
When you're on a quest to buy an espresso machine, you often reach a point where you've compared all the objective parameters, and start looking for how the machine makes you feel. 
So, this post is more about the emotional experience.

The goal of this post is to convert you to the lever side, whether you decide to get a Profitec 800, a Strega, or a Londinium. 
After reading this article, I recommend you visit the [Lever Espresso Machines](https://www.home-barista.com/levers/) forum on HB to fully immerse yourself in the culture.

I'll go over some of the factors that impress me as well as some of the drawbacks I find **using this machine daily**. I'll spare you the boring details, unless they're essential to the story.


### The Feels
I have always been curious about the experience of making coffee with a lever machine. The entire process
has a certain appeal that I find intriguing. So, I couldn't resist the temptation any longer and decided to finally try it for myself.
I have to admit, the first 10 shots were a bit of a disaster! They tasted absolutely awful, but there was still something kind of magical about using a lever machine.

As time passed, the routine became second nature. The shots improved significantly, and although the initial magic has worn off, the process still feels special to me.

Having upgraded from an entry-level machine, I'm pleased with the steaming pressure on my new device.
Through practice, I've developed a technique that allows me to brew and steam simultaneously, which is very convenient. 
I've even discovered how to steam no hands! simply by adjusting the steam wand to its lowest angle. 
Overall, I find the process to be engaging and enjoyable.


### The Controls
Lever machines provide a wider range of control compared to typical traditional espresso machines. 
While some modern machines include a flow control paddle, it can be difficult to adjust and requires a significant learning curve as it's not as intuitive as a lever. 
With manual lever machines (without a spring), baristas have complete control. 
However, I am satisfied with the "limited" control I have on my spring lever machine.

To be honest, there are some coffees for which I don't need to utilize the full range of control provided by the Profitec 800.
In these cases, I simply pull the lever and let the natural pressure decline take its course. 
The pressure doesn't remain at 9 bar; rather, it declines smoothly, resulting in delicious, creamy, and balanced espressos.

In addition, there's a gentle pre-wetting trick that involves pre-wetting the puck with water before pre-infusing it.
While pulling the lever, I pause briefly at the mid-position where the piston just uncovers the entrance to allow water to enter the group. 

This machine's pre-infusion pressure is solely dependent on the boiler's pressure. 
If you raise the temperature using the PID, you'll notice that the pressure gauge increases as well, also resulting in higher steaming power. 
However, for darker roasts I tend to lower temperature, having softer pre-infusion and weaker steam.

### The Looks

If you search for Profitec online, you might come across comments that their machines are a bit boring.
Some people say that the Profitec 800 lacks "soul".
But I have to disagree. I think it's absolutely beautiful. My only regret is that I don't have the V2 wood accents, which would make it even more stunning. 
The black colors aren't too shabby, though.

Every guest who comes over is always impressed by the machine. 
It's a great conversation starter and people get interested in the process of brewing coffee. 
I recently moved the machine from the back of the kitchen to a nice table near the living room. 
It stands on what used to be a large wooden table top for my computer setup.

When we drink coffee, we don't just care about the taste of it.
We appreciate everything that surrounds it.
Some people like a nice treat next to it, while others prefer their coffee served in an elegant cup or glass.
And how can we not appreciate a gorgeous coffee setup that is responsible for the great cup of coffee we enjoy? Watching [Tristan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rExr7R8TT_o) make coffee with all those levers certainly makes it look better.

I definitely appreciate having the Profitec 800 in our home. If it wasn't a lever machine, I would probably just keep it in the corner of the kitchen. But it's a beautiful machine that deserves to be seen and admired.

### All in all

I have to address the most important thing. It feels as if I have rediscovered espresso. **I actually drink espresso**.
I never enjoyed pure-espresso before. It's a shame, it always tasted too blunt, too bitter or too acidic. I have tried so many times in various cafes. I have tried with my previous machines, 
as well as drinking over at friends' places. Nothing. It's not that I don't enjoy a black coffee, nor do I drink any coffee with sugar.

Finally. At last. I drink straight espressos. Now, it still depends on the kind of coffee I'm drinkin. 
With some, I stil prefer to make Cappuccinos, Lungos or Americanos. I experiment with different roasts, too, I like darker roasts, however, I fell in love with particular medium roasts, too. But that's a 
discussion for another blog post.

The Profitec 800 is a capable machine for all roasts. It can handle light roasts, too. However, some say it shines with more traditional darker roasts, which resembles how they brew coffee in Italy.

Now, I'll address some of the disadvanages that I have found in my experience with this machine. For me, none of them are deal breakers, but they may be for you.

### The Drawbacks

#### 1. Long preheat time
Profitec 800 takes about 45 minutes to get up to correct temperature.
You can take a shortcut and flush water at a slow pace (mid-point lever position) and shorten the preheat time by 10-12 minutes.
Do not pull the lever all the way down because a large amount of water will gush, effectively achieving nothing but trouble. 

**Solution**: WiFi Smart Plug. I set up weekly schedule and it covers my coffee usage 90% of the time. However, sometimes I'd mistakenly switch OFF the machine itself, rendering the WiFi plug useless.

With machines that heat up in up to 20 minutes, it is a deal breaker for some. While not a deal breaker for me, as I known this fact before buying, it can be frustrating at times.

#### 2. Can't stop midway
Once you pull the lever down, a stream of wanter enters the chambers.
It's about 60ml of water, and you don't want all of that in your cup because it'll ruin your shot.

It requires an adjustment coming from a switch-pump-machine. I have ruined some shot because I didn't pull the cup for some reason.
They say you should remove it when you notice blonding in the coffee tail.

**Solution**: Use a small container for the remaining water and discard afterwards. Watch for the color of the top layer of your coffee to turn significantly lighter. 
You'll be able to time it with enough practice.


#### 3. PID doesn't control brew temp
The Profitec 800's PID controls the boiler temperature which is, practically speaking, a steam boiler. 
Meaning, its temperature isn't the goal temp you're aiming for your coffee. You must use the Scace device for precise temp.

**Solution**: Use community users' experience as a general guideline. I set up mine in a range between 120-124 celcius. Higher temp for lighter roasts, lower for darker roasts.

Keep in mind, lowering the temperature also lowers the steam pressure, i.e longer to steam your milk. But the Profitec 800 has plenty of steaming power anyways.

#### 4. No Built-in timer

Some machine have built-in shot timers, some machines embed them in the pid display. Profitec's PID is behind the driptray anyways, which is another con by the way.

**Solution**: I used a timer with my previous machine, and I still use it today. Old habits.

#### 5. Price
Let's talk about price. The Profitec 800 isn't exactly cheap, but it's not the most expensive lever machine out there either. 
It's a bit pricier than some other models like the Strega or the Quickmill Rapida, but still more affordable than the top-of-the-line Londinium.
Of course, whether the Profitec 800 is worth the price tag depends on your budget and your priorities, and your SO's opinion, as well. Thankfully, my partner **loved** it.
At the end of the day, the Profitec 800 is a special machine that's sure to impress anyone who loves great coffee. Yes, it's a bit pricey, but in our opinion, it's worth every penny.

Another lever machine to keep an eye on is the Londinium Vectis. However, as of writing this post, it is not yet in production, so it's hard to reommend.

### Summary

If you've made it this far, it's no secret that I'm a big fan of the Profitec 800 and would happily recommend it to anyone.
However, before making your purchase, there are a few things to consider and I hope this post has provided you with some helpful insights. 
While there are plenty of product reviews out there for the Profitec 800, this one focused on the subjective experience of owning and using the machine. 
If you have any questions about the machine, this site, or anything else related to coffee, please don't hesitate to reach out and let me know
