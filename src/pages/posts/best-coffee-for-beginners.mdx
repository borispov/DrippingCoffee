## How To Drink Black Coffee As Novice Coffee Drinker

Where I come from, Israel, black coffee means unfiltered brown *ground* coffee, in other words instant coffee. 
All you need is 1-2 spoons of ground coffee in a small cup, hot water poured-over, and sugar if you like. Sugar
is recommended to be added lastly. The upgraded version includes
preparing the coffee in what we call a [Finjan(Cezve originally)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cezve) and a camping gas stove. The Israeli black coffee has become a cultural property. So when you ask for a black coffee, this is what you get, *not* an Americano, Espresso or a filter-coffee.

Our black coffee doesn't taste like flowers, fruits, or other complex
notes you get with light-roasted Arabica beans brewed as Espresso or
pour-over coffee. Some locals call it "Mud", no joke.

All that context to say it took me a while to get used to the harshness
and bitterness of coffee. All coffee takes time to get used to. 

### Time

When we are born, we are naturally drawn to sweet tastes and develop the
rest of our test buds as we grow. Coffee is an acquired taste, that
takes some time to get used to its bitter and strong taste. I cannot say
how long it'll take you to acquire the taste of black coffee, if you're
used to coffee with cream or milk, it might be faster than if you've
never tried any coffee before.

### Regulate Bitterness

Feel free to add sugar, or top your coffee with milk or cream. How much
sugar? 1-2 spoons, just don't consume too much sugar. Gradually,
decrease the amount of sugar, milk or cream. If you're drinking
milk-based drinks, you can try machiatto or cortado that contain smaller
amounts of milk as starers.

Darker roasts tend to be more bitter and strong. You can get
a lighter-roast to even this out. Generally, try different kinds of
coffee available to you and see what suits you best. You can put more or
less amount of coffee and add more or less water to control bitterness
and harshness. 

### Kinds of black coffee
I think it's safe to assume that black coffee is coffee made without
milk. So, we're talking about Americanos, [Espressos](/posts/how-to-brew-the-best-espresso-shot/), Longs, Ristrettos,
Filter, etc. That being said, they all differ significantly in their
structure, method of preparation, and ultimately in taste. Personally,
I like espressos and something between an [Americano](/posts/upside-down-americano/) and a long espresso.
That is, espresso diluted with water but not too much water, right?

Before I bought mine [Profitec 800](/posts/personal/lever-experience/)
I used to drink filter Hario V60 and I enjoyed it a lot. I used to
consume lighter-roasts and enjoy the fruity schmuity flavor profile
which, with my Profitec 800, isn't as joyful. Made as espresso, I enjoy
flavors with more of a traditional profile, less acidic, more bitter
with nutty, caramel flavors over fruits and pleasant acidity. Coffee
made with Cezve tastes different, too.

You must experiment. Go on coffee tours, go to coffee events and forum
meet-ups, make friends who're into coffee and try different things. That
way, you'll get to enjoy and explore coffee made by people who are more
experienced than you are in a certain method. If you're into espressos,
it'll take time until you produce a god-like shot, and until then, you
may mistakenly make an assumption that you're not into espressos.

When at work, I mostly consume Israeli "mud", which is just instant
ground coffee prepared without milk. Ideally, we use a cezve on a gas
stove to brew it, in other conditions we just use boiling water from a kettle.

## Wrapping Up

Drinking black coffee has a whole history behind it in almost any
culture. Its harsh and bold taste resembles closely and more purely the
real taste of coffee. Personally, I tend to associate, perhaps falsely,
the effect of waking up and "zoning in" with black coffee more than I do
with a Cappuccino, for instance. It could be true because milk probably
does change something in the chemical structure of the beverage and its
effect on our organism, but this is way out of my scope so forgive me if
I'm completely off saying that.

If you're into black coffee, hurray!
If you're not into it, no worries, it's absolutely okay and you can
still enjoy and be enthusiastic about coffee without being a black
coffee fan.
However, if you're interested in acquiring that taste, remember to be
patient, don't force it too quickly. You can use sugar and gradually
lower the amount you add to it until you're pretty much used to the
bitterness and can genuinely enjoy a cup of coffee.
