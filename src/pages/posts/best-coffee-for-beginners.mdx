## How To Drink Black Coffee As Novice Coffee Drinker

Where I come from, Israel, black coffee means unfiltered brown *ground* coffee, in other words instant coffee. 
All you need is 1-2 spoons of ground coffee in a small cup, hot water poured-over, and sugar if you like. Sugar
is recommended to be added lastly. The upgraded version includes
preparing the coffee in what we call a [Finjan(Cezve originally)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cezve) and a camping gas stove. The Israeli black coffee has become a cultural property. So when you ask for a black coffee, this is what you get, *not* an Americano, Espresso or a filter-coffee.

Our black coffee doesn't taste like flowers, fruits, or other complex
notes you get with light-roasted Arabica beans brewed as Espresso or
pour-over coffee. Some locals call it "Mud", no joke.

All that context to say it took me a while to get used to the harshness
and bitterness of coffee. All coffee takes time to get used to. 

### Time

When we are born, we are naturally drawn to sweet tastes and develop the
rest of our test buds as we grow. Coffee is an acquired taste, that
takes some time to get used to its bitter and strong taste. I cannot say
how long it'll take you to acquire the taste of black coffee, if you're
used to coffee with cream or milk, it might be faster than if you've
never tried any coffee before.

### Regulate Bitterness

Feel free to add sugar, or top your coffee with milk or cream. How much
sugar? 1-2 spoons, just don't consume too much sugar. Gradually,
decrease the amount of sugar, milk or cream. If you're drinking
milk-based drinks, you can try machiatto or cortado that contain smaller
amounts of milk as starers.

Darker roasts tend to be more bitter and strong. You can get
a lighter-roast to even this out. Generally, try different kinds of
coffee available to you.
