### How Much Caffeine In ...

An interesting question. 
How much caffeine is in 1 tablespoon of ground coffee? 50-75 milligrams of caffeine.
How much caffeine is in 2 tablespoons of ground coffee? 100-150 milligrams of caffeine.
How much caffeine is in 2 tablespoons of ground coffee? Well, do the math. between 150-225 milligrams of caffeine.

#### However...

The amount of caffeine in ground coffee varies depending on several factors such as the roast level, origin, and grind size.

Research suggests that a moderate amount of caffeine, which is usually defined as 400 milligrams or less per day, is safe for most adults. However, individual tolerance to caffeine can vary greatly, and some people may be more sensitive to its effects. Pregnant women, children, and people with certain medical conditions should limit their caffeine intake. I was surprised to find [research](https://www.nationaljewish.org/NJH/media/pdf/Meltzer%20References/Warzac-(2011)-Caffeine-consumption-in-young-children.pdf) data on caffeine consumption in young children, which although found children's caffeine intake is higher than Canada's recommended range, there were some benefits. I'll let you do the readings yourself to avoid crucial misconceptions, so that you won't caffeinate your kids too much, right? 

A cappuccino typically contains about 75 milligrams of caffeine per 8-ounce serving. An espresso shot, on the other hand, contains about 63 milligrams of caffeine in a 1-ounce serving. A latte typically contains about 150 milligrams of caffeine per 16-ounce serving.

### Caffeine In Instant Coffee
Instant coffee contains varying amounts of caffeine, depending on the brand and preparation method. On average, 8 ounces of instant coffee contains about 60 milligrams of caffeine.

A moka pot, which is a traditional Italian coffee maker, typically yields a strong, espresso-like coffee. The amount of caffeine in a moka pot coffee will depend on the amount of coffee used and the size of the serving, but it can contain up to 90 milligrams of caffeine per 8-ounce serving.

It's important to keep in mind that the amount of caffeine in coffee and other caffeinated beverages can vary greatly, and can also be influenced by factors such as personal tolerance and the time of day. As a result, it's a good idea to monitor your own caffeine intake and to talk to a doctor if you have any concerns.


### Personal Experience
I love coffee, but I also have a great appreciation for science. Science recommends abstaining from caffeine intake approximately 8 hours before bedtime. If I find myself wanting coffee within that range, I'd make myself a cup of decaf with a small amount of milk, a *cortado*.

On some days, I caffeinate more than most days. Usually, if I need to laser focus better and perform cognitive or physical tasks. I can maybe consume a double shot of espresso before collecting the kids. However, I never cross the 400mg of caffeine for a total day.
