Before we start, there isn't one source of truth for caffeine content **estimation**. The best we can do is rely on general rules of thumb, and here are a couple:

* Arabica beans contain roughly between 8-12 mg of caffeine per 1 gram of coffee.
* Robusta beans contain roughly 16-22 mg of caffeine per 1 gram of coffee.
* Espresso has more caffeine concentration, Ristretto even more so.
* Filter / Pour-over brews tend to extract more caffeine from the same amount of coffee.
* Each study presents slightly different data.

## Caffeine In tablespoons

Measuring with tablespoons isn't a great measure because there isn't a single universal standard of a tablespoon volume.

How much caffeine is in 1 tablespoon of ground coffee? roughly 50-60 milligrams of caffeine.
How much caffeine is in 2 tablespoons of ground coffee? roughly 100-120 milligrams of caffeine.
How much caffeine is in 3 tablespoons of ground coffee? roughly 150-180 milligrams of caffeine.

## Caffeine Per Gram Of Ground Coffee
According to various [sources](https://www.coffeechemistry.com/caffeine-in-coffee), one gram of ground Arabica beans contains roughly 12mg of caffeine. Consider this an average within a possible range, rather than an accurate specific number. Robusta contains roughly 22 mg of caffeine per 1 gram of coffee beans. 

The amount of caffeine content in ground coffee varies depending on several factors such as the roast level and coffee origins.

## How Much Caffeine To Consume Per Day
Research suggests that a moderate amount of caffeine, approximately 400 milligrams a day, is safe for most adults. However, each individual has a different tolerance to caffeine. 
Some people are more sensitive to caffeine effects and cannot tolerate 400 milligrams a day without impairing side effects. Pregnant women, children, and people with certain medical conditions should limit their caffeine intake. 

I was surprised to find [research](https://www.nationaljewish.org/NJH/media/pdf/Meltzer%20References/Warzac-(2011)-Caffeine-consumption-in-young-children.pdf) data on caffeine consumption in young children, which, additionally to finding that children's caffeine intake is higher than Canada's recommended range, there were some **benefits**. I'll let you do the readings yourself to avoid crucial misconceptions so that you won't caffeinate your kids too much, right (joking)? 

As a parent, I would not feel comfortable giving coffee to a child until at least 13 years of age. But I may be old-fashioned, and anyway, you should probably consult a physician, not me.

## How Much Caffeine In A Cappuccino
It depends on how much ground coffee you use for a cappuccino, if you're using a single shot of espresso, then the caffeine contents are the same as in a single espresso shot. Therefore, a cappuccino made with a single espresso (7g) contains roughly 60 mg of caffeine. A cappuccino made with a double shot of espresso contains roughly 120 milligrams of caffeine. 

## How Much Caffeine In A Latte
A latte would have the same caffeine level as the double-shot cappuccino, unless the barista draws more water from the espresso, pulling a lungo. However, the caffeine will not rise significantly, as most of the caffeine is extracted in the first phases of extraction. Therefore a latte would contain roughly between 120-160 mg of caffeine if made with 14g of coffee.

### Caffeine In Instant Coffee
Instant coffee contains varying amounts of caffeine, depending on the brand and preparation method. On average, 8 ounces of instant coffee contains about ~70 milligrams of caffeine.

A Moka pot, which is a traditional Italian coffee maker, typically yields a strong, espresso-like coffee. The amount of caffeine in a moka pot coffee will depend on the amount of coffee used and the size of the serving, but it can contain up to 90 milligrams of caffeine per 8-ounce serving.

It's important to keep in mind that the amount of caffeine in coffee and other caffeinated beverages can vary greatly, and can also be influenced by factors such as personal tolerance and the time of day. As a result, it's a good idea to monitor your own caffeine intake and to talk to a doctor if you have any concerns.

### Personal Experience
I love coffee, but I also have a great appreciation for science. Science recommends abstaining from caffeine intake approximately 8 hours before bedtime. If I find myself wanting coffee within that range, I'd make myself a cup of decaf with a small amount of milk, a *cortado*.

On some days, I caffeinate more than most days. Usually, if I need to laser focus better and perform cognitive or physical tasks. I can maybe consume a double shot of espresso before collecting the kids. However, I never cross the 400mg of caffeine for a total day.
