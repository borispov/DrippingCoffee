## Robusta Beans
Robusta beans are the second most popular type of coffee bean in the world, after Arabica beans. They are known for their high caffeine (2x than Arabica) and strong flavor. Traditionally, Robusta beans were famously used in Espresso drinks in Italy.

Robusta beans differ from Arabica beans in their superior tolerance to pests and diseases, they're also considerably cheaper, they're more abundant, easier to grow and considered to have lower flavor profile. That isn't to say it's better or worse, it's just different. Usually Robusta beans feature more classic flavors like earthy, chocolatey, and nutty. Arabica coffee are sweeter and contain more fats than Robusta. 

### Roast
Robusta tend to be more tolerant for high temperature compared to
Arabica beans. It can easily achieve darker roasts. Take note, that
Robusta isn't used as a single origin, for example, it's common to blend
it. It isn't uncommon to have blends that have 80% Arabica and 20%
Robusta. Some blends use the Arabicas to soften and sweeten the taste.
You should also be wary of which Arabicas you use to blend with Robusta,
as you can easily ruin your batch. Be mindful of your Robusta beans
supplier, try to purchase premium high quality beans, not the most
common industrial commodity.

### Best Roast Level
As much as I wished to roast my own coffee at home, I don't. Not jus yet. Therefore, I'm not entitled to write a comprehensive article on how to roast the best Robusta coffee. However, to address the question: "What roast level is best for Robusta coffee?", let's start with the annoying statement: "it depends". I know, right? 

It depends on the flavors you would like to extract from your coffee.
Generally, because the Robusta can withstand longer roasting, darker roasts can be achieved without damage to the bean. The darker the beans get, the sugar caramelizes, enabling some sweetness. However, keep in mind that Robustas are still fundamentally different from Arabicas so direct comparisons aren't to be made. Robusta will taste stronger no matter what you do.

A light-roast, charaterized by a light brown color and more acidic
flavor, typically achieved right before the first crack at around
360-400F. It's less common to roast Robustas to a light-roast level,
since it's less characteristic with the usual Robustas flavor profile.
You're free to experiment, and remember Robusta are great to combo with
Arabicas. 

Medium roast always serves as the middle ground, providing a balanced
effect with acceptable acidity, body and a slightly chocolatey and nutty
flavor. It's also perfect when blended and used in either espressos,
pour-overs, and whatever really.

<Note content="I've been looking for the perfect Italian-like classic espresso taste and settled for a 70/30 Arabica/Robusta blend with a dark-roast level" />

Dark roasts provide the harsh, intense kick you might be familiar with
if you had espresso without sugar in Napoli. It can balance out acidic
Arabicas and add a body basis which can be great for your lattes and
cappuccinos, as well as traditional-like espressos, which I personally
like a lot. 

As I might've stated elsewhere, I came to appreciate less acidic flavors
in my espresso and I tend to like darker-roasts generally. However,
I found that even medium-darker roasts of some Arabica beans still yield
an unpleasant acidic feel to it, so for espresso I prefer a good blend.

### Rules Of Thumb

- Always make sure you're using high-quality beans, try to find the best
supply source. This is easily overlooked and is often the reason people
bash on Robusta. Enormous amount of Robusta coffee shipments don't undergo quality control procedures that many Specialty Arabica farms do, resulting in bad quality coffee. There is special robusta coffee, too, so do your research before purchasing.
- Don't roast just like you roast your Arabicas, adjust
accordingly, keep close attention to that first crack sound so you can avoid over-development resulting in burnt beans. Read the characteristic flavor profile, cup your roasted beans and write notes! 
- Write notes for every batch you roast, see what you like and didn't like
and research how to eliminate unpleasanties until you enhance your roast game.
- As far as storage goes, the same applies here. Keep your beans in an airtight, cool and dry container.


## Finally
Whether you're about to roast your own Robusta beans, or just wanted to
