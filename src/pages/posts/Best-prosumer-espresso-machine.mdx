# Best Prosumer Espresso Machine

Everybody makes coffee at home, but not everybody is into coffee so seriously that they are willing to spend a fortune on a prosumer espresso machine. The path into obsessive home coffee brewing is different for everyone, but one thing is clear: once you commit, it’s nearly impossible to go back, and needless to say there’s almost always one step forward. You know, the kind of step that involves parting from more money, of course.


### What are prosumer machines, anyway?

Imagine we have a spectrum with consumers on one end, commercials on the other end, and the Prosumer in the middle. Generally speaking, prosumer machines are products designed for advanced hobbyists and enthusiasts. 

On the consumer side of _coffee making,_ you’d probably get _instant coffee_, _drip makers_, _Nespresso_ and all other _pods machines_. Gradually, you’d have people using _french press_, _pour overs_, and _moka-pots _and entry-level espresso machines. Although, [some coffee enthusiasts ](https://coffeeadastra.com/)really tinker pour-over coffee in-depth. 

Commercially, well, you have (usually) bigger machines, sometimes old and loud, sometimes modern, quiet, and super expensive. Commercial espresso machines tend to require more electrical power and thus are not suitable for the home setting, they are usually found in cafes and restaurants. In some circumstances, you must use a commercial machine that meets certain sanitary and safety certificates. They are usually plumbed in, featuring 2 group heads, and are oriented for producing high volumes on a constant basis.

Prosumer espresso machines, finally, are powerful beasts designed for home usage. Their features may be familiar to those of commercial machines but with lesser power requirements. They’ll more often than not come with a smaller boiler, they can either be a plumbed-in version, reservoir based, or both (_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Profitec 800</span>_). Among other differences, the faster heat-up time is a notable one. Prosumer machines take anywhere from 10-15 minutes to 35-45 minutes to achieve temp stability.


### Sizes, prices, use cases.

The prosumer espresso machine can cost anywhere from [500$ for entry-level machine](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1zdY7G6x1T9fLNO72Hl2s19lZBjuCKAFkJiTD0krytU0/edit), up to 1,200$ for mid-level machines, and 3,000$+ for high-end machines.

I’m not entirely sure what would be the best approach to categorize prosumer machines. One way is to divide them into Single boilers, Heat exchange, dual boilers, and [lever machines](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/113LZbBDfr9K-4oPj44L7mw_V8ePveXzXboaGapFhy20/edit). Although lever machines also have those types of boilers, their design and operation deserve a separate category. Bear in mind that single boilers tend to be the cheaper group, and DBs (or dual boilers) tilt towards the expensive side.


# Single Boilers, Entry Level Espresso Machines

Note that entry-level machines are not always the best for beginners. Those machines often require utilizing tips and hacks like _temperature surfing_, _cooling flushes,_ and longer times between brewing espresso and steaming milk. Single boiler machines are great if you’re mainly drinking espresso and only seldom need steaming capabilities for hosting guests, for example.

Speaking of single boiler machines, a couple of machines are worthy of serious consideration. There are the Gaggia and Silvia which are quite similar in some areas and different in others but I’d still group them together, and then there is the ECM Puristika which is an entirely different beast.


## Gaggia Classic Pro Vs Rancilio Silvia

Both machines are known as great entry-level machines across all espresso communities. Rancilio Silvia released a newer V6 version in 2022, while Gaggia’s latest release was in 2020. The Silvia has a larger boiler which means it takes slightly more time to heat up, but arguably, provides better steaming capabilities. The operation of both machines is very intuitive with switches up front for power, brewing, and steam warm-up. Temperature stability on both machines isn’t something to brag about and usually would send hobbyists on a path of upgrading the machines by adding a PID which takes some tinkering and costs money. Personally, owning a Gaggia Classic Pro I did not install the PID and didn’t want to spend money and time on upgrading it since I knew I’ll end up selling the unit and upgrading to a better machine sooner or later.

If you’re prone to _upgraditis_, you might want to pass on the Single Boiler altogether and jump straight to HX or DB machines and enjoy a significantly better quality of life. Many would argue it wouldn’t me much about the taste of the cup as it would be your joy and QOL. It’s up to you.


## ECM Puristika

It isn’t a machine for beginners who are looking to make the perfect cappuccino, latte, or americano at home. If you’re a strict espresso drinker and don’t need steaming at all, this is worth a **strong** consideration.

It’s worth getting for the unique look and design only. It features an <span style="text-decoration:underline;">external</span> 2L water reservoir. It has no steam wand and no water tap. The Puristika has a classy E61 group mounted on a chunky and sturdy machine. 

The Puristika is really a small machine and the external reservoir doesn’t stand as an annoyance, it can be simply hidden behind your grinder. It’s narrow, compact, and has an extraordinary, compelling view it compliments any kitchen. 

Key features (taken from idrinkcoffee):



* 0.75L Single Boiler
* Commercial E61 Grouphead
* Vibratory Pump
* Adjustable expansion valve
* External glass water tank
* PID that doubles as a shot timer
* Exceptional German Engineering

You can control the maximum brew pressure within a narrow range between 8 and 10 bars. It is not to be mistaken with flow profiling. There should be an optional flow control valve available, although I’m not sure how much you’d be adding to the total costs.

The machine goes for approximately 1,000 euros.


# Heat Exchangers Espresso Machines

Heat exchanger machines have a large steam boiler and a special copper tube that goes through the steam boiler and into the brew group head. The copper tube draws water from the water reservoir and runs it through the boiler’s high temperature, thus flash-heating the water to a proper brewing temperature. This isn’t the most temperature-stable design by nature but it’s a great solution for many. There are many more engineering elements and aspects to it, feel free to explore further if you’d like a more in-depth explanation of how HX design works.

Here’s a link with an in-depth explanation:




## Lelit Mara X

Most HX machines require a certain workflow on the user end, usually featuring flushes. However, one of the recent machines manufactured by Lelit, is the Lelit Mara X. It’s a modern, top-of-the-line HX machine that features an E61 group with astonishing fast heat-up times and no need for cooling flushes while also providing plenty of steaming power.

The Mara X is a narrow, deep but compact espresso machine that features a stainless steel boiler and overall design. It looks like your traditional E61 machine, with the standard lever-up operation for brewing.

The Mara X has an additional flow control valve that can enable flow profiling capabilities.

Honestly, I won’t be adding any more machines next to the Mara X,

since anything that is a “better’ HX machine than the Mara X will be stepping into bigger Dual Boiler machines and honestly, you may be better off purchasing a reliable DB machine rather than an expensive HX machine. I think this is the best HX machine, and the best bit is it’s relatively affordable.


# Dual Boilers, i.e The Big Brews

Dual boilers don’t need much explanation like the Heat Exchanger or even the Single Boiler machines. Those machines have 2 boilers, each boiler has a separate, dedicated job. A brew boiler is set to brewing temperatures and a steam boiler to steaming pressure. Those machines do not require any sort of cooling flushes and temperature surfing tricks. You simply brew, and steam simultaneously if you want, and you’re done.

Usually, the more expensive the machine, the better the temp-stability features and build quality will be. There are at least a couple of worthy mentions with varying prices, so let’s get to it.


## Lelit Elizabeth 

The Elizabeth is a very capable machine with one of the cheapest price points for a dual boiler machine. In fact, there are countless buying advice discussions over Elizabeth vs Mara X since their prices are very close to each other.

Lelit Elizabeth is a dual boiler machine with fantastic features that you simply cannot afford to ignore. Let’s go over the advantages, shall we?

**PROS**



* Programmable soft preinfusion
* Programmable shots. After you dial in your espresso, all you need is to click and wait
* Plenty of consistent and powerful (2bar) pressure.
* Accurate PID controlled brew temperature 
* Saturated group, faster heat-up times
* A relatively quiet vibratory pump, it is said to be more silent than the Mara X.

There are some caveats with this machine, its build quality isn’t Lelit’s top-of-the-line, which is reflected in a couple of ways.

**CONS**



* A plastic tamper that is more of a joke than a tamper
* A plastic steam knob which is an aesthetic turn-off
* A water reservoir that is inconvenient to refill.
* Looks. If you like the traditional E61 kinda look, skip it and get the Mara X or Bianca at double the price.
* Control. If you think you’re going to want that flow control, either get Mara X and install the paddle or as I said, get the Bianca and get it over with for good.

To be honest, not many machines provide enormous value like Elizabeth for such a small price. If you’re looking for the best value, and you are fond of its design, then you have yourself a great coffee machine without a question. Despite the numerous cons listed above, the advantages far outweigh them. 

It does not fall short in any area, provides plenty of features and power for espresso drinkers, and cappuccino & latte lovers, and can host a small gathering of guests & friends pretty easily. You should watch [Stefano’s videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMRf8lDBGPU) demonstrating the output this machine manages back to back.

**Lelit Bianca**

This machine is a beast. It has been praised unanimously [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXC-9GrWIKg), [here](https://coffeeequipmentreviews.wordpress.com/2018/07/17/lelit-bianca/), and [here](https://www.home-barista.com/blog/lelit-bianca-review-t54489.html).

While it is NOT cheap, it is the least expensive among its competitors. Take note that the Bianca comes with a flow control paddle built in. The flow control is a rather advanced feature that beginners are recommended to not bother with too much in the beginning of their espresso journey. The flow control provides you with such control to extract different flavors and use different types of extraction ratios and grind sizes that all affect the end result.

The Bianca is still a great fit even for most beginners because it’s a machine that will grow and expand its capabilities along with your skills. Out of the box, the machine does everything one needs to pull a great cup of espresso and steam perfect microfoam milk for their cappuccino or latte. Given you leave the paddle unused, the learning curve on the Bianca is as with all espresso machines, but with the convenience provided by two powerful boilers and excellent engineering for near-perfect temperature stability shot over shot. There’s plenty of power for making back to back drinks to host a small party as well. The Bianca is also a beauty to look at with the stock walnut accents and the traditional E61 design. The Bianca is a machine that will serve you right from your first dive into making okay espresso all the way to the leading edge of experimenting with different brew ratios, grind sizes, and all types of coffees.

The Bianca does cost between 1,800€ in Europe and 3,000$ in the US.

Some users prefer the German build quality and go with the ECM Synchronika. It’s heavy, sturdy, and overall a great machine. It also has an option for a line pressure preinfusion when you plumb it in, whereas the Bianca can be plumbed in but with no effect on the preinfusion. You couldn’t go wrong with either one.


## Let’s Wrap

I am familiar with the great feeling that comes with the decision to purchase an espresso machine and improve your coffee experience at home. It’s a celebration. Until you begin devouring endless threads with a flood of useful information that shortly becomes overwhelming. Truth is, there isn’t one perfect machine. There are a bunch of hard working manufacturers that produce awesome prosumer espresso machines that we can choose from. If your budget is restricted, the machines I mentioned above can fit almost any budget starting from as low as 500$ up to as high as 3,000$. While there are plenty more prosumer espresso machines, even more, luxurious like the whole La Marzocco line, I believe it’ll direct you towards what you need to get started/upgraded.

Bear in mind, though, that no matter how good your machine is, it’ll be bottlenecked by a poor quality grinder. Many life-long espresso hobbyists recommend investing in a good grinder before getting an expensive espresso machine. So in case you intend to spend up to 1,200$ on your espresso equipment, you should probably get a[ budget espresso machine](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1zdY7G6x1T9fLNO72Hl2s19lZBjuCKAFkJiTD0krytU0/edit) and a quality grinder like the Eureka Mignon or the DF64 grinder. A poor grinder won’t be able to keep up with your espresso machines and various coffee beans you might want to try.

Feel free to reach out and ask any questions, I’d be happy to answer with my limited knowledge or refer you to information and resources if needed.
