### An upside down americano with ristretto shots

What is this? Another funky Starbucks invention? Yes. No. It depends.

An Americano consists of an espresso and hot water, with a roughly 1:1 ratio, some may prefer more water. Usually, 2 questions often arise:

#### 1) 1 or 2 shots of espresso?
It depends on whether you'd like more or less caffeine and how big of a drink you'd want. If you want a larger drink, like many do, if not simply for enjoying it longer, then you might want to have 2 shots of espresso in. If you don't mind a shorter Americano, then 1 shot will suffice. 

Technically, you can pour 1 shot of espresso and add more water. You will, however, dilute the espresso too much and lose the deliciousness. You'll lose the whole point.

That being said, do whatever tastes best for **you**. My wife, for instance, doesn't care much whether it's a single or a double shot with the same amount of water. She doesn't care if it's upside down Americano or a downside up Americano.

#### 2) Americano water first or last?

*That is why we're here. Right? not necessarily. Let's try tackling the question.*

The traditional method of preparing Americano is preparing the espresso first and then slowly and carefully pouring hot water, allowing the crema to mix up with the water, hence balancing the flavors without destroying the crema.

The second method involves pulling an espresso shot right into your hot water cup. Some say it's more visually appealing, the crema remains visible and feels *right*. Personally, this is the way I make Americano first thing in the morning. I take a moment to enjoy the sight of the crema and then stir everything up!

**But wait, what's with the upside down ristretto shots?**

Well, there isn't much sense to it besides the fact that instead of pulling a regular shot of espresso, you're pulling a ristretto in. Another connotation could be a cappuccino or a flat white that is made by pouring the steamed milk first and pulling a ristretto on top, rather than the other way around.

### My version of Americano or Long Black

Every morning, I prepare Americanos for my wife and myself. Usually, I make a double shot Americano for my wife, pulled into a cup with hot water, with a 1:2 or 1:3 ratio. For myself, I split a double shot into 1 single shot of espresso and a short Americano. My Americano is also roughly of the same ratio. However, my espresso ratio depends upon the coffee roast and blend I use. For instance, my current blend is 75% Arabica, 25% Robusta, medium-dark roast. I grind 15g and expect a 50ml beverage. That's a 25ml single shot of espresso and 25ml for the Americano mixed with roughly 70ml of water.

Up until recently, I used to add more hot water to lessen the strength and concentration of the espresso. I find that the more diluted the espresso is with water, the more it loses its delicious flavors and gathers unpleasant flavors. As I said, though, my wife doesn't care much and just likes to enjoy a longer experience of sipping coffee.


#### Long Black
I'm not absolutely certain that the way of preparing Americano is what makes a drink Long Black or an Americano, but I have also heard that a [Long Black is simply a double shot with a longer extraction time](https://elijahcoffee.com/upside-down-espresso-shot-by-starbucks/). I don't like this idea. 

[Here](https://tangycoffee.com/lungo-recipe/), the author advocates for a 7g dose of ground coffee with a 60ml extracted beverage. I'm shivering just from the thought, imagining how I sink the shot after the initial sip. I think 7g in -> 25ml out is long enough.

Letting a shot brew longer extracts the bad parts of the coffee, messing up the fantastic flavors that were extracted before the so called "blonding phase" of extraction. Some say that a long-shot will taste weaker than standard shot and I disagree. Letting more water run through the coffee puck isn't the same as adding water to the espresso shot. The water that runs through a compressed puck of coffee, after reaching a certain point, extracts different flavors that worsen the shot significantly.

Now, to be fair, some coffee roasts allow for notoriously different brewing techniques and ratios. Coffee hobbyists with machines like the Lelit Bianca, use the flow control paddle to make all sorts of coffees, including imitating French Press and Pour-over brewing, all within the realms of an espresso machine. That would require a whole other discussion and it isn't at all what's meant by Long Black coffees offered by various coffee shops, so beware and proceed with caution before ordering a Long Black!
