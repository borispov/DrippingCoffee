## How To Make An Americano At Home

Caffè Americano is very easy to prepare:
1. Brew espresso using your [preferred method](/posts/what-is-the-best-espresso-maker-for-home-use/)
2. Fill your desired cup or mug with water (at least 2x the amount of espresso)
3. Stir lightly, Enjoy!

### What Is An Americano?
Caffè Americano is espresso diluted with water to soften the strength of the espresso. If you look online for a recipe, you'll find many recommended different espresso to water ratios, because everyone has their preferences. Besides, there isn't one way or a perfect way.

My go-to espresso to water ratio is usually a 1:2 or a 1:3 ratio, whereas Maya (my wife) prefers more water than I do, she'd have a 1:4 / 1:5 ratio and enjoy the drink. I have tried many recipes, and sometimes even my own recipe changes, because frankly, I do not measure the water.

The ratio essentially means that for 40ml of espresso and 200ml of water, we got a 1:5 ratio. Many associate an Americano with a high-volume drink and tend to brew double shots of espresso into 8-9 oz mugs and fill the rest with water. It dilutes the espresso too much for my taste.

What is this? Another funky Starbucks invention? Yes. No. It depends.

### A Single Or A Double Shot For Americano?
It depends on whether you'd like more or less caffeine and how big of a drink you'd want. If you want a larger drink, as many do, if not simply to enjoy it longer, then brew 2 shots of espresso. If you don't mind a shorter Americano, then a single shot will suffice. 

Technically, you can pour 1 shot of espresso and add more water. You will, however, dilute the espresso too much and lose the deliciousness. It's pointless and quite tasteless. 

That being said, do whatever tastes best for **you**. My wife, for instance, doesn't care much whether it's a single or a double shot with the same amount of water. She doesn't care if it's upside down Americano or a downside up Americano.

### Americano Water Or Espresso First

What goes into the mug first, water or espresso? It depends.

The traditional method of preparing Americano is preparing the espresso first and then slowly and carefully pouring hot water, allowing the crema to mix up with the water, hence balancing the flavors without disturbing the crema too much.

In the second method, we pull the espresso right into your hot water mug. That way the crema sits on top beautifully, it feels right and is definitely worth a picture. This is how I make my Americano every morning. I take a moment to enjoy the sight of the crema and then stir everything up (gently)!

But, to be honest, sometimes I do the opposite and I don't really care much, it's still delicious. Some people don't like the fact that crema is on top because the crema itself is bitter and unpleasant. There's truth to that, but to counter that argument, I gently stir my Americano and, Ecco fatto!

Some regard the second method of preparation as the process of making a *long black*. Let's see.

## What Is A Long Black

Strictly speaking, a long black is prepared with a double-shot of espresso poured over hot water. In other words, it's reversed Americano and typically it's made with less water, adhering to my recommended low ratio of 1:2. That is to say, some have a 1:5 ratio of espresso to water with Americano, but technically, they can have the same ratio making a long black, would that still be considered as a Long Black drink or an Americano?

I have seen online that a [Lungo is simply a double shot with a longer extraction time](https://elijahcoffee.com/upside-down-espresso-shot-by-starbucks/). I don't like this idea.


**But wait, what's with the upside down ristretto shots?**

Well, there isn't much sense to it besides the fact that instead of pulling a regular shot of espresso, you're pulling a ristretto in. Another connotation could be a cappuccino or a flat white that is made by pouring the steamed milk first and pulling a ristretto on top, rather than the other way around.

## Long Black vs. Americano 

Americano: Pour espresso first, hot water into espresso. Varying ratios, 1:2 for small drinks and 1:5 for larger drinks.
Long Black: Fill hot water first, and pour espresso over the hot water. Typical ratio of 1:2.

Worldwide, the Long Black is more popular in New Zealand and Australia, although, it gains popularity in the US, as well. The Americano is known worldwide and is more popular perhaps. A quick funny story, Russians tried to split with the Americans again by naming the drink Russiano.

## Personal Preferences

We are not able to detect significant differences in flavor between the two recipes. Therefore, we don't have clear preferences as to what is the best drink to have. This highly depends on whether I want a fast drink with strong and intense flavors and mouthfeel or take my time with a larger drink. Most of the time I have a long black or straight espresso, especially in the morning. Occasionally I'd drink a larger, Americano.

No matter what I have, I take a little sip from the espresso first. If it's bad, it goes into the sink. Why? Because bad espresso makes an utterly horrible drink! So, I do a little sip-check, then pour the rest onto the water or the opposite, pour the water into my espresso. 

*Always, always check the espresso before making an Americano or a Long Black*

Last note, I find that the more I dilute the drink with water the more I lose the coffee's richness and flavors. Thus, a less intense doesn't mean it'll be more pleasant to drink, quite the contrary. Experiment. Try having your Americano a little shorter, OK?

## Lungo
A lungo is a double shot with a longer extraction. I don't like this. IMHO, this is just over-extracted coffee that can easily get too bitter to enjoy. Perhaps some like, Nespresso even made lungo pods which may be the cause of its popularity. Personally, I don't get this.

That being said, technically, a lungo means longer extraction which is often what I do on my [Profitec 800](/posts/personal/lever-experience/). Some of my shots take up to 45-50 seconds to pull including the pre-infusion phase. I'm not sure it qualifies as lungo, [what do you think](/contact/)?

To be fair, some coffee roasts allow for notoriously different brewing techniques and ratios. Coffee hobbyists with machines like the Lelit Bianca, use the flow control paddle to make all sorts of coffees, including imitating French Press and Pour-over brewing, all within the realms of an espresso machine. That would require a whole other discussion and you might be interested in reading some of [Jim Schulman's](https://www.home-barista.com/tips/newbie-flow-color-vs-weight-to-stop-extraction-t67171.html) thoughts on the subject.

## How To Make An Iced Americano

Now, what about making an iced americano? This is one of our favorite drinks in the summer. As with any espresso-based drink, the key to a great iced americano is solid fundamentals, i.e. a good espresso. Like I said, if I ruin the espresso, I ruin the americano. We can't shamefully mask our mistakes with sweet, foamy milk. We're at our espresso's mercy.

Next, add as much water as you'd like as well as the amount of cubes. Remember, don't exaggerate with the amount of water you add, diluting your coffee too much will result in a dull, bad-tasting coffee. I'm going to experiment with really small amount of water along with a couple of cubes, effectively drinking an iced long black coffee.

Should you pour espresso over ice or not? I honestly don't know whether there is any difference, I don't think there is much. If it's aesthetically pleasing, then please go ahead. I'm of the opinion that the visual experience is very much an essential part of the whole coffee experience.

## General thumb rule: Taste First.
Especially if you changed a setting like temperature, grind settings, dose, coffee beans, etc. Taste your espresso before turning it into an Americano, Iced Americano or a Long Black. It's faster to iterate that way. If you've got a terrible shot, make a new one. I also follow that rule when I'm preparing a cappuccino, too. Some shots are so terrible even milk won't cover them.

I hope you've learned what is an Americano and how to make a great one at home. We've also shed some light on the subtle differences and similarities between Americano and Long Black, we've also briefly touched on lungos. Go make good coffee, and if you want me to cover anything else in particular, [let me know](/contact/).
