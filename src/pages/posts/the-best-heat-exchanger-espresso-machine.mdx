## What Is A Heat Exchanger Espresso Machine

In a nutshell, a heat exchanger is a single boiler machine with
very hot water that is cooled down on its way to brewing coffee via the heat exchanger system. The result is a machine that is capable of steaming and brewing
simultaenously, or at least not requiring any additional warming up
steps known to the Single Boiler machines like the [Gaggia Pro]
(/posts/reviews/gaggia-classic-pro/). 

Heat exchangers offer a better experience compared to SB for those who
make milk-based drinks at a slightly higher cost. However, the gap
between the HX and DB machines has been narrowed significantly thanks to
Lelit. Depending on where you're from, [Lelit Elizabeth](/machines/lelit-elizabeth/), an entry-level dual-boiler machine may cost the same as the Mara X, which should be worthy of your consideration.

## What Is The Best Heat Exchanger? Lelit Mara X.

Answering such a question prior to modern espresso machines like the Lelit Mara X was a difficult task. Today, however, with the engineering advancements that Lelit has presented with the [Mara X](/machines/lelit-mara-x/), it's not quite as challenging.

I'll spare you your precious time and tell you right away: The Lelit
Mara X is likely the right option for you **if**:

- You want a machine that is budget-friendly.
- You don't want cooling flushes
- You want a compact and solid machine overall.

The Lelit Mara X is a great choice for most people looking for a heat exchanger machine in 2023. It's very compact, and its small footprint will fit anywhere. It's relatively quiet, especially with Lelit's adjustments over the development of the Mara (currently V3). Not needing cooling flushes is a huge bonus. On top of all, it's an E61 design, however, it doesn't have the preinfusion function of a traditional E61, which is something to be aware of. The heat up time is around 25 minutes, which I'd consider fast.

We have two modes: Coffee and steam mode. With coffee mode, we're not
required to preform a flush, with steam mode, we are. Coffee mode is
designed so that you brew coffee without flushing, with a hit on
steaming pressure. Mind you, it's not like the pressure is absent, it's
just weaker than it'd be with a steam mode.

Using steam mode, you're getting a regular HX machine that requires
cooling flushes. On top of that, we have 3 temperature settings that
serve as a PID: Warm, Hot, Extra Hot. 

The only downsides of the Mara X for the average user may be **aesthetics**. It's a very narrow and compact machine, and some may be after the classic boxy and bulky E61 looks. I can't argue with that because I, too, own a bulky and boxy machine (with a lever, though). The other thing is, some users complain about the machine requiring rebound time between each shot, not being able to brew fast back to back shots. Personally, I wouldn't find this limitation relevant for my usage and for most prosumers either.

### Mara X vs. The World

Let's approach the question, "What is the best heat exchanger machine?",
from a different angle. We'll start with an assumption that the Lelit
Mara X is the best espresso machine in its category, but it faces tough
competition from some of the most popular contenders in the market.
Namely, those are: ECM Mechanika Max, **Bezzera BZ10, Profitec 400/500, QM Rubino,
Rocket Appartamento, and some others.

An HX is an HX no matter what brand is behind it. HX machines have
great benefits like providing great performance with only a single
boiler, simple internal construction, cheaper than most dual-boiler
machines. Alongside those benefits, they also carry major drawbacks:
- Their temperature is hard to control even with a PID
- They're like a tango between steaming and brewing and require cooling flush to manage brew temperature.

Most HX machines have those benefits and issues in common. The Lelit Mara X, however, is a unique one. the uniquness of the Mara sets it apart from the rest of the competition while being one of the cheapest options, isn't that great? What's so great about it? It has **solved** the drawbacks I mentioned above.

I think the Mara X is the only HX machines you can walk up to and make
a shot without flushing. Others can do that too, with some tuning, and
such tuning would mess up the temperature of consequent shots, so it
isn't all-good.

So, how to does it compete with the rest? Let's find out.

## ECM Mechanika Max

[The Mechanika Max](https://www.wholelattelove.com/products/ecm-mechanika-max-espresso-machine#product-features) is the latest release from the german ECM brand. The Mechanika has a traditional E61 group head, it features a PID, and a smart display to let you know whether or not you need to flush. The ECM Mechanika has a rotary pump, a 1.9 L stainless steel boiler, 1600w heating element.

The Mechanika has a built-in scheduler that you can setup two different times with, you can use that or a get a smart plug. You need that because the machine takes about 35-45 minutes before it's ready to operate with a stable temperature. The Mechanika has a smarter heating system with a PID that is supposedly even better than Mara X's temperature ranges, but only supposedly because with HX you cannot get as accurate as you'd like. The Mechanika has a probe measuring the temperature inside the machine, which does not reflect the temperature of the water coming out of the group head, however, you can set an "offset" setting in the menu to account for this fluctuation.

The Mechanika has joystick controls instead of knobs for steam and
water. There are preinfusion possibilities with this machine, you can an
active and passive preinfusion, the passive is possible when you plumb
the machine and you get line pressure preinfusion. The active
preinfusion is programmable via the menu, it's a little cumbersome, and
then there's the mid-lever-position option which is perhaps the easiest
unless you can plumb your machine and achieve line-pressure preinfusion.

There are three temperature modes that affect the way the machine heats
up, and there's a button to boost the steam heat-up while brewing your
shot. This machine offers a great set of features that sets this machine
apart from most of the traditional HX machines, as well as the Mara X in
some ways. You can also set the machine in a temperature control mode
for operation without a cooling flush.

That being said, the price difference is significant. The Mechanika
costs almost twice as much! In the US, The Mara X is a bit more
expensive than it is in the EU, so the difference is smaller, but it's
still significant.

I don't think this machine is the Mara X killer, mainly because of the
price tag. For this money you can get a dual-boiler. You can get a [Lelit
Elizabeth](/machines/lelit-elizabeth/) and have some spare money for accessories, etc. Finally, it does offer some very important features for a Heat Exchanger, similar to how the Nurri Leva addresses some of the pain points in the lever espresso machines, like the ability to stop the shot with a side paddle, and more.


## Bezzera BZ10
[BZ10](https://www.bezzera.it/en/machines/bz10) comes from a respectable brand, Bezzera, known for making robsut
and quality espresso machines for years. The BZ10 is an HX machine with
a proprietary group head from Bezzera. The different group head heat up
faster, but, reportedly they have a lower clearance, requiring lower
doses.

The Bezzera BZ10 has a vibratory pump, and uses an adjustable pressurestat to
control the pressure of the boiler. It has a 1.5L boiler and a 1200W
heating element, it takes about 25 minutes to get up to stable
temperature.

The BZ10 is a classical, no-fuss, espresso machine with minimalistic
aesthetics. I think it's available with a wood kit, somewhere, which
makes it much cooler. They're both compact machines with small
footprint. The drain pipe is internal and the outlet only protrudes
aboe the tray making up more space under the group head.

Overall, the BZ10 is a simple HX machine with little maintenance
required. The Mara X is more modern and has a "smarter" design with its
approach to temperature management. 

The Lelit Mara X requires no cooling flush and the Bezzera BZ10 does
require regular flushing. Both are great for medium and dark roasts coffees, they can also work for lighter roasts but it's a bit more challenging and require a certain routine.

### Bezzera BZ10 vs. Mara X

And the winner is... Mara X. It's obvious that I'm biased towards the
Mara, but, I truly appreciate the appeal of the BZ10. If you can get
a good deal on the BZ10, or find a second-hand that was properly
maintained, it's a great machine. But, if you're getting a new one,
the only reason you'd go with BZ10 over the Mara X, is for Bezzera's
brand and its group head, the design & feel of the machine, and that's
all largely. I think the BZ10 might offer a stronger steaming pressure
due to the way the Mara is programmed, but I wouldn't get the BZ10
solely for this. Mara X can work nicely without flushing with a decent
steaming pressure that is far and beyond the pressure I had with my
Gaggia Classic.

## Profitec 400 & Profitec 500

The Profitec 400 resembles Mara X a lot with its compact design and its
feature-set. It has no PID but 3 selectable temperatures with 2 degrees
deviation between each mode. It has a smaller, 1.6L stainless steel
boiler, which should be almost identical in terms of performance and
steaming capabilities. The Profitec 400's build quality feels more solid compared to the Lelit's Mara X, featuring a true, traditional E61 group head and a double pressure gauge.

### Profitec 500
One of the most expensive heat exchanger machines is the Profitec Pro
500. With a machine like the Lelit Mara X and Lelit Elizabeth, is the Pro 500 still worth it? No. Yes. It depends.

The Profitec 500 V2 features an amazing design with wooden accents on. On top of that, it's the most solid and
robust heat exchanger you can get. It has a 2L stainless steel boiler,
a PID to control the steam temperature, separate pressure gauges, and
a programmable ECO mode. I feel like it's the heat exchanger version of
my Profitec 800.

There are two major drawback and they are: **price** and warm up time. It might be tempting to save some money and get a Lelit Bianca, or simply get a Lelit Elizabeth and spend the rest of the money on a better grinder or accessories. Next, the warm up time is quite long compared to Lelit and Bezzera. Prior to the ECM Mechanika Max, I think the Profitec 500 had a respectable place among the best heat exchangers. Now, however, I'm not so sure anymore. The higher price tag makes you want more given the amount you're investing in an espresso machine, it may be better to save a bit more and get a dual-boiler. 

## Rocket Appartamento

Before the Mara X came out, the Rocket Appartamento was probably one of
the most popular choices among heat exchangers and was an obvious
upgrade path for many prosumers upgrading from the Gaggia Classic Pro to
heat exchanger. The Appartamento is rock solid machine, with a distinctive
design and a traditional E61 group which takes longer to come up to
temp. 

Rocket's Appartamento has a copper boiler with a capacity of 1.8 L,
together with the massive E61 group, it takes up to 35-40 minutes to reach temperature stability. In contrast, the Lelit Mara X achieves this in almost half the time, with only 20-25 minutes of warm-up time. 

Additionally, the Appartamento does not have a PID, it has a pressurestat that you can adjust. Effectively, increasing the pressure will increase the performance power of steaming and increase the boiler's temperature. Decreasing, will do the opposite, obv. Bare in mind, adjusting the pressurestat requires [opening the top case and so on](https://support.clivecoffee.com/rocket-appartamento-adjusting-pressure-stat). The Mara X offers much more convenient temperature control as mentioned above.

Speaking of operation, the Appartamento is a classic HX machine that
requires flushing to remove boiling hot water in order to prevent your shots from being ruined. Additionally, it requires some recovery time between each shot. 

Aesthetically, I think the Rocket is more beatiful, but personally,
I wouldn't rule out the Mara X based on looks only. Besides, it's not
that the Mara X is bad-looking or something.

I think Lelit Mara X comes a bit cheaper in most countries, which along
with all of the other differences, does make the Lelit Mara X the most
obvious choice between the two.

Ultimately, the Lelit Mara X is the **winner** between the two. However,
if you own an Appartamento, you should **NOT** switch to a Mara X, it's
only an upgrade if you're coming from a single boiler machine. Moreover,
if you dig the E61 and Rocket's distinctive brand look, you wouldn't go
wrong purchasing it over the Mara X, but at least you'll know the
differences beforehand, ok?


## Summary

Despite all the good things I mentioned about the Mara X, it's best you
preform your own research to supplement everything that might be
missing. For instance, it's a good idea to visit a User Experience
thread in various forums and skim through some user discussions. Every
machine has some issues that are more or less common and you can see to
what lengths users have gone through to fix some issues, add certain modifications and so on. Some modifications of the Mara X include a [data visualisation](https://www.home-barista.com/espresso-machines/lelit-marax-data-visualisation-mod-t66187.html) which is totally fascinating.

I hope you enjoyed this article so far and I got you curious enough to
make your own research and dig some more. More than anything, I hope you're now better informed on the topic of Heat exchangers before making a buying decision.
