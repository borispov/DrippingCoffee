_This post is focused on semi-automatic espresso machines, not full-automatic ones._

Coffee has become more accessible than ever, especially espresso. It's no longer a drink exclusive to cafés. 
Everyone can produce great coffee at home. With a *relatively* low budget, you can start your home brewing coffee journey.
In this post, I'll provide an overview of capable espresso machines under $500, so you can take your first step into the world of coffee.

However, before you buy a semi-automatic espresso machine, it's important to note that there is a learning curve involved in making a good cup of coffee, particularly with espresso.
With automatic machines, anyone can click a button and get the same result.
With semi-automatic machines, your skills determine the quality of the cup.
But with practice and preparation, you'll be rewarded with a better-tasting cup and the satisfaction of making it yourself. 

Let's get started!

## **The Best Semi-Automatic Machines for under 500$**


### [1. Breville Bambino Plus](https://amzn.to/3yZlRyZ)

**TLDR: A no-brainer. There isn't anything alike. It's compact, it heats-up fast, has automatic steaming, easy maintenance, and a generous accessory kit. For just 499$ on Amazon, it's a steal!**

The Bambino Plus is the number one on this list for a reason. Breville does very well with their products and they sure know how to appeal to bigger crowds, accomodating beginner baristas and those on a lower budget.
You'll be making impressive cappuccinos and delicious americanos, you'll be working on your braista skills and having fun without overwhelming yourself both financially and well, mentally.

The Bambino Plus stands out among even the big boys like the Gaggia Classic Pro and Rancilio Silvia for its **fast** heat-up time and easy maintenance. The heat-up time is super essential since machines like the Gaggia Classic Pro take at least 15 minutes to bring up to temperature stability for brewing or steaming.

Another great feature of this machine is the option to steam milk automatically. You can just fill up the jug with milk, insert the steam wand, choose your steam preferences and you're all set. The steam will start and stop automatically, and on top of that, when you're done it'll purge itself after frothing your milk which makes life easier.

Despite being small and compact with great style, it features a full-size portafilter & steam wand,  which in turn form a professional machine kinda-look. However, it doesn't just look professional, it is a serious step up compared to automatic machines and Nespresso pods machines. 

This machine ships with a rich accessories kit, including three filter baskets with a pressurized and non-pressurized basket for those who still don't grind their own coffee and buy pre-ground. It features a razor tool for evening out your puck after tamping it, and of course, a 54mm tamper (not a plastic one, thanks Breville!). A special addition is a 16 oz (480ml) milk jug, even the luxurious high end machines do not include a milk jug.

Please, keep in mind, this machine does not include a built-in grinder like some of the other (more expensive) Breville models. What that means is that if you want to have good coffee daily, you'd be better off purchasing a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">grinder</span> and purchasing fresh coffee beans.

It's one of the most satisfying espresso machines for beginners because it's fast and easy to operate, and does not require hands-on barista experience to produce delicious coffee. Keep in mind, however, if you are prone to level up fast in your hobbies, you might end up looking for an upgrade pretty soon.

Is this the best espresso machine? Absolutely not. It is, however, the **best bang** for the buck. For just 499$ on amazon, it's a steal.

### 2. [Gaggia Classic Pro](https://amzn.to/3yZlRyZ)
<img class="product-image" src="/assets/blog/gaggia.webp" alt="gaggia classic pro - black color" />

**If you're looking for a machine that feels like a real semi-automatic espresso machine, this is the one for you.
It's the sturdiest, heaviest, and most robust option on this list.
However, note that it doesn't come with automatic maintenance or steaming features, so you'll need to rely on your own skills.**

The machine that took me from Nespresso pods to a genuine appreciation of all things espresso. A couple of years ago, after endless research both online and offline with other coffee hobbyists, I decided to get the Gaggia Classic Pro. Gaggia is an Italian company established in 1947 that still makes great coffee machines to this day. Some of the old Gaggia machines (lever machines) still operate and work flawlessly today, but the company's focus is primarily on modern machines. The Gaggia Classic Pro is the flagship espresso machine that is extremely popular online all over the world, you can find countless forum threads with tips, hints, tricks, and support for just about any hacks and issues.

In short, the Gaggia Classic Pro is a popular, cheap entry-level machine that is capable of producing top-level coffee. It's a solid and reliable product that can last you decades with proper maintenance and care. The GCP has an enthusiastic following that has modded this machine into beast mode with PID, adjusted OPV for SOP pressure, and more.

In recent years, this machine was upgraded and is now offered in various colors to your liking.

Let's go over this machine a little bit more in-depth than we did with the Bambino Plus, because it's a little more robust and has a couple of more interesting details to be aware of.

* A single boiler. It has an aluminum boiler with approximately 100ml capacity. It is considered a small boiler in comparison to expensive mid-high-end machines, but it is a **proper** boiler that heats up within 15 minutes (there are tricks to get it up to temp faster).
* A 3-way solenoid valve that serves to release pressure from the group head after brewing your shot. The pressure is released into the drip tray in form of water drops. This is good but requires backflushing as a regular maintenance operation, otherwise, you collect stale and dirty coffee in your shower screen. 
* An industry standard-sized 58 mm portafilter. Plenty of accessories are available for that portafilter size (baskets, bottomless portafilters, tampers, etc).
* A commercial steam wand and a barista-like steaming operation.

When preparing a cappuccino or a flat white, you'd turn on the steaming switch to bring the boiler up to steaming pressure which takes about 35 seconds. It's best to start steaming just before it reaches the pressure so that you don't lose the pressure over time. The steaming power is plenty enough for absolute beginners and will enable you to pour some incredible latte art.

The machine comes with both pressurized and non-pressurized baskets. The pressurized baskets are dedicated to pre-ground coffees. If you don't have a grinder, then you probably have to buy pre-ground coffee and use a pressurized basket to get okay-ish results. The pressurized baskets, along with the machine's 15 bars of pressure, will help create a beautiful shot of espresso, although it'll only look like a perfect shot, and most probably not taste like one.

It doesn't mean it's wrong. It's totally okay. In fact, most home baristas aren't interested in making the best possible espresso, nor are they interested in spending loads of money on a dedicated competent grinder. However, if you are interested in honing in your barista skills, you must get a grinder, and certainly a good one!

The machine also comes with a tamper. Though, it's more of a joke than a tamper. I recommend you purchase a [solid tamper](https://amzn.to/3DeUB20) along with your Gaggia Classic Pro.

All things aside, this is a perfect entry-level machine for those who seek hands-on barista experience and like to see the results of their skills and preparation. If you want something more beginner friendly, go with the [Bambino Plus](https://amzn.to/3yZlRyZ).


### 3. [Flair Signature](https://amzn.to/3VMgFbv)

This is a manual espresso maker. It does not require power, it does not have a boiler or a water reservoir. It is capable of producing **the-best-espresso** you have ever tasted. It's portable, you can take it anywhere you'd like, although you still need to prepare some ground coffee ahead of time. 

This is a manual espresso maker meant for espresso drinkers. You'd need a separate, dedicated milk frother if you want a cappuccino. Please, watch James Hoffman's video to understand the process involved in making an espresso with the Flair. There are numerous significant differences between the various Flair models that you must take into consideration.

[Click here for the Flair Signature with a pressure gauge](https://amzn.to/3F27gXw) (I do not recommend getting the most basic Flair, the pressure gauge is very handy in terms of controlling and understanding the variables involved in the process) it costs less than 200$

[Click here for the Flair PRO 2 ](https://amzn.to/3F0Wj8k)which features a large brew head and allows for bigger ratio and drink volumes.

Keep in mind that to extract (sorry) the best results you must have a suitable grinder. By suitable, I mean a grinder of high quality that usually costs quite a bit of money. There is no sense in using pre-ground coffee with the Flair or even grinding with the cheapest grinder you can afford.


### 4. [Nespresso Vertuo Plus](https://amzn.to/3grWP5c)

Okay, so we've been through some of the best semi-automatic espresso makers as well as manual lever ones. Now, it's time to make some room for the automaticas. 

Nespresso has been widely known for its convenient one-touch coffee-making experience, with a variety of pods offering all kinds of tastes. Many, in fact, most of the people who make coffee at home, are not into hands-on barista experience and are perfectly happy with Nespresso machines, or other pods-machines. Aside from Nespresso's marketing, there's a reason it appeals to a large population.

This is the Nespresso Vertuo Plus. It's meant for espresso, meaning there is no milk frother attached to it, so if you'd like a cappuccino you'd either get another machine or you'd get a dedicated external milk frother. The coffee you get from this machine and Nespresso, in general, is an entirely different experience from the traditional espresso we were once accustomed to. Today, the tides have turned.

The Vertuo Plus is a small machine with a minimalist design. It's “up-to-temp” very fast and offers an auto power off after 9 minutes of inactive time. There are various type of pods you can use with Vertuo system, and the machine is smart enough to recognize the type of pod and brew coffee according to the type of pod. Every pod has different size. Some pods yield a tremendous amount of coffee. In fact, I think Nespresso has invented a whole new range of drinks with luxurious names.

Personally, I am not into that type of experience. Although, I have had a [Lattissima Touch](https://amzn.to/3SmLAbe) as my first coffee machine ever, and I loved it. Well, until I wanted more from coffee. The prices of those machines are appealing, and the ease of buying various kinds of pods is also appealing so you can taste different flavors within a switch of a pod, instead of buying whole bags of coffee beans or pre-ground coffee.

Finally, the aesthetics. The coffee looks gorgeous. Especially when you make some of the super milk drinks with Lattissima Touch, it's breathtaking. We all know that aesthetics are an inseparable part of the whole coffee experience along with smell and taste, and Nespresso certainly adds up to that. But again, personally, I enjoy a beautiful extraction of espresso, knowing that if the crema appears to be there, it's a real crema. But, that's just me. Enjoy your pods :-)

Some points to consider apart from by hinted cringe from using a pods machine:

Nespresso ecosystem. Nespresso locks you in to use their pods and their pods ONLY. Some people don't mind, while others dismiss those machines on principle.


### 5. Lattissima Touch

**A simply and easy to use Nespresso machine, equipped with 19-bar pump, an automatic frother and a one-touch system.**

Finally, I present the Lattissima Touch, a popular Nespresso machine manufactured by DeLonghi.
A few years back we received this machine as a gift from my Mother, and it certainly was a great gift because it introduced us to making coffee at home. We truly enjoyed our time with it and the beverages it made us.

In essence, it's an easy-to-use machine with a user-friendly design. It has a 19 bar pressure pump instead of the new Vertuo's centrifugation system which is sort of an advantage. It features a one touch milk frother and programmable drink types. You can predefine the amount of beverage to fit your favorite cup size. It's an amazing feature that complements its “One-Touch” philosophy. 

The maintenance on this machine is largely straightforward with descaling requirements being the major thing. If you'll be feeding your machine with tap water, you MUST descale regularly. Otherwise, you'll end up ruining your machine to the point it won't be worth repairing. This is true for most machines. On my machine, I have run a little late with descaling and probably have caused serious issues. Even after descaling, I had dirty water coming through the machine. I would turn on the machine, and brew water without pods, and the output water wasn't clean and included tiny particles.

Thankfully, I got myself searching for a new machine that has set me on the right track of brewing espresso, like real espresso with real crema — not the fake crema produced by high pressure in Nespresso machines. But hey, I'm not judging. Like I said... and I will rephrase.

The Lattissima Touch is - ABSOLUTELY - a great choice for those who want a beautiful and a nice-tasting cup of coffee and want that ease of use. It has a 44 oz water reservoir and a 12 oz milk container along with 6 beverages preset. 

**Personally, I wouldn't recommend this machine to those who want to experience brewing real espresso at home. There are other options like [Breville Bambino Plus ](https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BES500BSS-Bambino-Espresso-Stainless/dp/B07JVD78TT)with relative user-friendliness in mind to get you going.**

## Verdict

If you'd like to a closer barista experience, get one of those: Bambino Plus, Gaggia, Flair. Mind the Flair is manual, no boiler. It's not for everyone. 
You'll have to invest more money on purchasing a good grinder and a supply of fresh coffee beans.

If I could decide today, I would skip the Lattissima Touch, and get the Gaggia Classic Pro instead. I'd also consider the Silvia, or even look for a used one.

There are some additional worthy mentions that didn't make it to the list because they're slightly more expensive, like the Rancilio Silvia and some of the Lelit's entry-level machines (Anna PID?).

{/* In case you're going with a Gaggia Classic Pro, this is my list of accessories that I absolutely recommend you get. Some of the accessories are a MUST-HAVE, so it's best to order them along with your machine and not wait for their arrival. */}

I hope you found this article beneficial.
