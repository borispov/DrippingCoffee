## Is A Double Shot Of Espresso A Lot?

Most adults in the US, according to a [2016 research](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/8/3/154),
consume an average of 135mg of caffeine daily which is on the lower end
of the recommended daily caffeine consumption which is roughly between
100-400mg of caffeine. Of course, it doesn't apply to adolescents,
pregnant women, and people who suffer from various health conditions.

According to this, having 2 shots of espresso is okay for most people. Though, some people may experience anxiety and jitteriness without exceeding the recommended upper limit, so you should be attuned to how your body reacts to caffeine. Some people can have more than 400mg of caffeine and feel as though coffee barely affects them, while others may find their bodies much more sensitive to even smaller amounts of caffeine. It largely depends on one's caffeine tolerance and personal preferences. 

### How Much Caffeine Is In Espresso?
It's important to understand how much caffeine in an espresso shot to determine how much is *too much*.
A single shot of espresso is about 7-9g of coffee and about 75 mg of caffeine. Two shots of those contain about 140mg to 150mg of caffeine which is on the lower end of the recommended daily caffeine intake. It can be considered safe and sort of explains why Italians can drink single shots of espresso throughout the day. However, if you consume two shots of a **double** espresso, you're potentially consuming as much as 400mg of caffeine which is on the higher limit of the recommended daily caffeine intake. 

It's best advised to avoid coffee consumption beyond the daily
recommended dosage, i.e. avoid exceeding 400mg of daily caffeine.

### The Time Of The Day Is Crucial

While the amount of caffeine intake is important to consider, it's
important to consider **when** you're having coffee. Health experts
recommend you to avoid having coffee late in the evening to avoid
serious health implications because it can impair the quality of your sleep. Having coffee and still being able to fall asleep doesn't mean
you're immune to those negative implications. You can fall asleep but
the quality of your sleep will be damaged.

_Note: My wife used to drink coffee in the evenings and easily fell asleep at night. She'd be tired throughout the day and tend to consume
more coffee during work than she does today, after she stopped having
coffee after 4-5 P.M._

<Note content="It is best to stop any caffeine intake 8-12 hours before bedtime to avoid any negative effects on your sleep." />

I have touched on the [benefits of coffee](/posts/coffee-and-health/) on your health before, which you’re welcome to read, but I’d mostly like to stress that the potential long-term damage of drinking coffee regularly after recommended hours far outweighs any benefits and enhancements. [Dr. Matthew Walker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxAoSgMM_L8) has taught us how good sleep quality can enhance our life quality and longevity, so let’s keep enjoying our coffee, but responsibly. Sorry for the cringe.

### Brewing Method And Brewing Ratio

The brewing method and brewing ratio can also vary the amount of caffeine
that is in a cup of coffee. For example, you can achieve a 400mg limit
by having 2-3 drinks of espresso versus 5 cups of French Press, versus
2 cups of pour-over coffee (250ml each). On the other hand, it highly
depends on the number of drinks you serve, because not everyone drinks 250ml cup of pour-over coffee, some prepare a lower volume drink. I used
to make a low-volume cup with my Hario V60.


## Wrap Up
To summarize and answer the question again, a double shot of espresso
contains roughly 140mg of caffeine which is safe for most people.
However, having multiple doses of those is where it can become tricky
and may require caution. Having too much coffee can cause unpleasant
symptoms that can affect your daily functioning and productivity,
moreover, having coffee in the evening before bedtime can damage your
sleep quality. It's best to avoid coffee 8-10 hours before your usual
bedtime.


### FAQ

#### - How much caffeine is in one shot of espresso 
Around 75mg of caffine.

#### - How much caffeine in a double shot of espresso 
Around 150mg of caffine.

#### - How much caffeine in 3 shots of espresso 
Around 225mg of caffine.

#### - How much caffeine in 4 shots of espresso 
Around 300mg of caffine.


#### - Is 3 shots of espresso a lot 
It depends. If you consume 3 shots throughout the day, it's most likely be just fine. You must be
attuned to your bodily sensations and check whether you're sensitive to the effects of caffeine. Look out for signs like jitteriness,
feeling overwhelmed and anxious. Same goes for having 3 shots of
espresso in one go, while it's not inherently dangerous, it might be
too much if you're not used to such volume. Furthermore, it limits
how much *more* caffeine you can ingest afterwards without crossing
the daily 400mg recommendation.

#### - Is 2 shots of espresso a lot 
Again, it depends. TLDR; For most people, it's fine.
The double espresso caffeine content is around 150mg which is quite
a balanced amount. You can consume a double espresso in the morning
without limiting the caffeine volume you'll be able to consume later in
the day. I recommend paying high attention to what feels right to YOU.
