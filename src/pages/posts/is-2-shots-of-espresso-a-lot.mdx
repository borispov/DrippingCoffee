## Is 2 shots of espresso a lot?
Having 2 shots of espresso is okay for most people. Though some people may experience anxiety and jitteriness without exceeding the recommended upper limit, so you should be attuned to how your body reacts to caffeine. Some people can have more than 400mg of caffeine and feel as though coffee barely affects them, while others may find their bodies much more sensitive to even smaller amounts of caffeine.

### Two Shots Of Espresso Caffeine
Two shots of a single shot of espresso contain about 140mg of caffeine which is on the lower end of the recommended daily caffeine intake.

If you drink 2 shots of a double espresso, then you’re potentially consuming as much as 400mg of caffeine which is the higher limit of the recommended daily caffeine intake. It is wise to not consume any more coffee after having 2 shots of (double) espresso and avoid exceeding 400mg of daily caffeine intake.

### The Time Of The Day Is Crucial
However, the amount of caffeine intake isn’t the sole factor you should consider. The time at which you drink your coffee can have significant health implications. For example, if you consume your 2nd shot of espresso late in the evening, it'll negatively affect the quality of your sleep. It is best to stop any caffeine intake 8-12 hours before bedtime to avoid any negative effects on your sleep.

I have touched on the benefits of coffee on your health before, which you’re welcome to read, but I’d mostly like to stress that the potential long-term damage of drinking coffee regularly after recommended hours far outweighs any benefits and enhancements. Dr. Matthew Walker has taught us how good sleep quality can enhance our life quality and longevity, so let’s keep enjoying our coffee, but responsibly. Sorry for the cringe.

### Brewing Rations Effect On Caffeine
Keep in mind, we haven’t discussed brewing ratios, meaning we did not speak about how much coffee you receive in the cup, i.e the output. This is mainly because different people like different brewing ratios. Some will use 1:1 for ristrettos, 1:2 for (now) traditional double shots, and some brew with a 1:3 ratio so that 20g beans of coffee have a yield of 60g of beverage. Pour-over coffee ratios feature absolutely different brewing ratios like 1:10 to 1:15 and more depending on the recipe. While there may be some chemical differences in the resulting drink, you should still follow the thumb rule of approximately 10g of coffee containing about 80mg of caffeine.
