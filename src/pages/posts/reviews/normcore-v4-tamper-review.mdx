## Normcore Tamper V4 Review: Best Spring-Loaded Coffee Tamper?

The moment I tried my friend's Normcore Tamper V2, I realized I've been
missing out on some of the best QOL items for home coffee making. This
spring-loaded & calibrated tamper not only produces consistent results,
it *feels* great in your hands.

If you're still using your machine's stock tamper, you should upgrade
**now** and get the [Normcore V4 Coffee Tamper](https://amzn.to/4cESrYC).

This tamper features a dual-action leveling design that ensures even pressure application. It eliminates the risks of uneven tamping. With customizable springs offering pressures from 15 lbs to 30 lbs, this tamper caters to various preferences.

One standout feature is the innovative leveling plate that helps maintain consistent pressure, ensuring a perfect puck every time. Available in multiple sizes, the tamper is compatible with a wide range of espresso machines, adding to its broad appeal among home baristas.

## Overview of the Normcore v4 tamper
I don't know the origins of *NORMCOREWARES* as a company, but I do know
I like their products more and more each and everytime I try something
new made by them.

This tamper is no different.

The Normcore 58.5mm Coffee Tamper V4 brings noteworthy features to the table. Its spring-loaded design eliminates the need to manually gauge pressure. This tamper simplifies the process, ensuring consistent pressure every time.

The tamper's ergonomic handle offers a comfortable grip during use. A significant improvement from previous versions is the central shaft design, which now supports interchangeable springs. Users can switch between different pressure settings (15lb, 25lb, and 30lb) with ease.

The combination of an anodized aluminum handle and a 304 stainless steel base ensures durability and easy maintenance. The leveling plate keeps each tamp even and balanced, reducing the chances of an uneven tamp and ensuring smoother extraction.

## Regular Tamper vs Spring Loaded Tamper

We all know the regular tampers, they're allegedly straightforward.
Though, as a beginner soon you'll wonder what's the best angle to press
from, how much pressure to apply and what other tricks should you
master. This method is familiar to many, but it leaves room for variations and inconsistencies in pressure, which may affect the quality of your espresso and cause frustrations.

I think especially when starting out, there are so many variables to
wrap your head around, it's helpful to take one of them out.

## Ease Of Use

The Normcore Tamper includes three interchangeable springs, each designed for different pressure levels: 15 lb, 25 lb, and 30 lb. This flexibility allows users to fine-tune the tamping process to their preference.

Swapping the springs is straightforward. The standard 25 lb spring, which is pre-installed, suits most users. For those seeking a lighter or heavier tamp, the additional springs provide that customization.

The Normcore Tamper's leveling guide rests on top of the filter basket as you press down, eliminating uneven pressure. It reduces user strain and prevents common tamping errors.

The spring-loaded mechanism offers three interchangeable springs to control the pressure. The anodized aluminum handle provides comfort, while its flat, stainless steel base ensures stability. To use, simply press and turn clockwise for optimal results.

This method achieves a uniform tamp every time, enhancing espresso shot quality. The design caters to both beginners and seasoned baristas.

## Should You Buy Normcore Spring Loaded Tamper?
