An essential tool for any barista, an espresso milk jug is used to steam and froth milk for lattes, cappuccinos, and other espresso-based drinks. A good espresso milk jug should be durable, easy to handle, and have a spout that allows for precise pouring.

When choosing the best espresso milk jug, it's important to consider the size and material of the jug. The size of the jug depends on how much milk you'll be frothing at once, while the material can affect the temperature of the milk and the durability of the jug.

After researching and testing several espresso milk jugs, I've identified the top options for both home baristas and professional baristas. Whether you're looking for a stainless steel jug or a non-stick option, we've got you covered.

## [Normcore Handless Milk Pitcher](https://www.amazon.com/Normcore-Handleless-Milk-Pitcher-Stainless/dp/B0BBP9YRYP?tag=dc0d7d-20)

You've probably seen those in your favorite barista videos on Youtube, and may have been wondering if that's actually comfortable or something you'd use for a couple of times and give up altogether. Long story short, I think this milk pitcher is a fantastic piece of equipment for your photography and vids, however, it also makes a great companion for your latte art. Not having to use the handle will be something to get used to at first, but soon you'll discover your pouring technique and flow is a little bit different from what you're used to. Some folks prefer this method of pouring over
traditional pitchers with a handle.

If you've got some spare budget for accessories, definitely give
this pitcher a go. I tend to use whatever I feel like without clear preference for one or the other, but I can say that the
handleless (or handless) pitcher just feels right in the hand, the feel of thickness and the grip is just spot-on. My latte art is kind-of-lame no matter what I use, so ... I cannot truly testify to the improvement or lack thereof of using this pitcher.

A sound disadvantage that I can think of using the Normcore
Handleless Milk Pitcher would be not feeling the temperature of the milk on the side of the pitcher. You can still put your hand on the bottom of the jugg, though. Alternatively, just use a simple [thermometer](https://amzn.to/4eKFo9r), I think this is the most precise method.

### Pros

* The handleless design improves control and precision when pouring for *some people*.
* The accurate spout is wide enough to balance a steam wand and allows for testing the heat of the milk at the bottom of the jugg.
* The heat-resistant grip ensures the pitcher feels secure and balanced in your hand.
* Awesome looks and feels!

### Cons

* Somewhat harder to test milk temperature
* Some say it's a pain to clean.
* The sleeve isn't removable

I recently purchased the Normcore Handleless Milk Pitcher and was impressed with its design and quality. The handleless design made it easy to control the pour and create precise latte art. The wide spout helped balance the steam wand.

The heat-resistant grip is comfortable and secure, and the 1mm thickness premium stainless steel made the pitcher feel durable and balanced in my hand.

Overall, if you're looking for a milk pitcher that allows for precise latte art, easy frothing, and premium feels and looks the [Normcore Handleless Milk Pitcher](https://amzn.to/45LUTtO) is a great choice for both professional and home baristas.

* The 600ml version is too large for a single cappuccino, but great for a latte or 2 cappuccinos in one go.
* The premium quality comes at a higher price point than some other milk pitchers on the market.
