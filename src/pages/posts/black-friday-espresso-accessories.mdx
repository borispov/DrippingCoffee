Hello, The Black Friday Espresso machines and tools list we've all been
waiting for is here!

I've been waiting for 2023 Black Friday so much, and it's finally here!
There are some tools and nicities I wanted to add to my coffee station
but I've been delaying the purchase. Let's see what Black Friday has got
for us home baristas, shall we?

This is a curation of some of the tools I found to be interesting and
some of them are definitely on my wishlist.

1. De'Longhi La Specialista EC9255M Arte Evo - [27% discount](https://amzn.to/3sGVDkU) - While the
   Breville Bambino Plus doesn't go under any discount on Amazon, it
   seems, there is a greater substitute: De'Longhi La Specialista
   EC9255M. A semi-automatic espresso machine that comes with a built-in
   grinder and a professional steam wand. The advantage over the Bambino
   Plus is it doesn't require a dedicated espresso grinder!
2. Gaggia Evo - [~~$499~~ - $454](https://amzn.to/49NTjJF) The newest
   Classic Pro version the Gaggia Classiv Pro **EVO**.
3. Philips 2200 LatteGo - [~~649$~~ - ONLY $555](https://amzn.to/3sHsEgG) - An automatica
   espresso machine that has a good reputation and is being currently
   sold with a significant discount. I don't usually cover nor talk
   about automatic machines, but, there you go. In case you want an
   automatic machine for all your household members to use and prep
   their own coffee without fuss, have at it.
4. Normcore 58.5mm V4 spring tamper - [~~$44~~ - $35](https://amzn.to/46sf52u) - a great tamper, now at a sale price. This is the time to grab it.
5. Normcore 58mm WDT V2 - [~~$80~~ - $63 20% discount](https://amzn.to/3Ga0jD6) - a distribution tool for those who want a fancy one over a simply DIY one. 
6. Espresso Knock Box - [$32 - 20% discount](https://amzn.to/47yRnCY) - I don't know whether it's a good or bad one, they all look pretty
       much the same but this one is quite cheap, so, if you're looking
       for a coffee tamping station and a knockbox, there you go.
7. MHW-3BOMBER milk jug of various sizes - [up to 40% discount!](https://amzn.to/3R4MkV8) - You can't go wrong with a milk jug addition to your coffee station, you can't have too many jugs, right? I'm sure I'm getting myself one of these ASAP especially with the discount.

8. DOZARMOTA Coffee Mat Finally - [$17](https://amzn.to/47IlnMm) a coffee mat - I love those! This isn't much of a sale, but if it wasn't for black friday, I'd probably miss that one. I loved mouse pads as a gamer, and I keep using my gaming mats for my coffee station as well. Now, I can get myself a proper coffee mat that looks like it belongs to the coffee station rather than my computer.

I hope you'll enjoy 2023 Black Friday and get yourself everything you've
been missing so far in your coffee station, or get yourself the espresso
machine you always wanted. This isn't an exhaustive list, obviously, and
you should probably go look into other websites and vendors in the US
for Black Friday deals on the espresso machines that you want.

## What Espresso Machine To Get?

Black Friday offers great deals but all of those deals and discounts can
cause a lot of confusion in regards to choosing the right espresso
machine for you. I've written a guide on choosing [the best prosumer
machine](/posts/best-prosumer-espresso-machine/), and [choosing a budget espresso machine](/posts/best-espresso-machine-under-500/), and [a lever espresso machine](/posts/best-lever-espresso-machine/). I hope you'll find those useful and helpful in your life-changing decision.
